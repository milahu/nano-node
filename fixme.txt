FIXME undefined reference to `boost::log::v2_mt_posix::sinks::text_file_backend::~text_file_backend()'

i have tried ...

change boost version

add to CMakeLists.txt ...

  add_definitions(-DBOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK)

  find_library(libboost_log_so boost_log lib/libboost_log.so)
  target_link_libraries(Boost::log INTERFACE ${libboost_log_so})

  # https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/46
  add_definitions(-DBOOST_LOG_DYN_LINK)

  # https://github.com/boostorg/log/issues/18
  list(APPEND Boost_LIBRARIES boost_log_setup)

  SET(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)

... but nothing helps

probably this requires Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS
but nixpkgs has only dynamic boost libs
